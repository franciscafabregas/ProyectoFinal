		Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from a mixture of milk, sugar, and flavorings such as fruit or cocoa, which is kept creamy by the combination of fat, air, and water crystals. 

Basic ingredients: Milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings such as vanilla, chocolate, or fruit.

Emulsion: The freezing and blending process creates a stable emulsion of fat, air, and water crystals, resulting in a smooth, creamy texture.

Variety: There are different types, such as those made with dairy, those made with water, and those that combine both.
